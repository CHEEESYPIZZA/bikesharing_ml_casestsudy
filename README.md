## General Information
- Project Background: This study investigates the elements that influence the demand for bike-sharing systems in metropolitan areas. By anticipating utilization trends, we can help local governments and private enterprises successfully manage and develop bike-sharing systems.
- Business Problem: The project's goal is to maximize the deployment of bike-sharing resources by forecasting demand changes. This helps to reduce operational expenses and improve customer happiness by making bikes available when and where they are required.

- Dataset Used: The dataset includes hourly rental data for two years. It contains weather conditions, holiday information, working day status, and timestamps.

## Conclusions
- Weather Impact: Weather conditions have a considerable impact on bike rental patterns, with clear days seeing a higher number of rentals than wet or snowy days.

- Temporal Patterns: On weekdays, rentals peak around morning and evening rush hours, indicating that they are heavily used for commutes to work and school.

- Seasonal Trends: Demand rises in the spring and summer, with a substantial dip in the winter, indicating that weather influences consumer preferences.

- Policy Implications: Dynamic pricing and reallocation tactics during high demand periods may improve revenue and service dependability.
